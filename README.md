# das-minimal-extension README

## This is for our noggit scripting project. There is no dascript support in tswow itself.

(very) quick hack to get basic code completion, signatures and definitions for das files. Only made this because the official version kept crashing on me, and all I want from intellisense is to not have to memorize function names. 

We parse the file every time we edit it, so it's very inefficient, but it has worked fine for me so I won't bother fixing a real parser. If you need a good das extension, support the official project instead.
